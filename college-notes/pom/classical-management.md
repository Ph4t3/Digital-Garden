# Classical Theory

## **Three Main Branches**

* \*\*\*\*[**Scientific Management \(Taylorism\)** ](classical-management.md#scientific-management)- _Frederick Taylor, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth_
* \*\*\*\*[**Administrative principles \(Fayolism\)**](classical-management.md#14-principles-of-henry-fayol) - _Henry Fayol, Mary Parker Follett_
* \*\*\*\*[**Bureaucratic organisation**](classical-management.md#bureaucratic-organizations) - _Max Weber_

> Each of these approaches shares a common assumption that employees in the workplace act in a rational manner, and are primarily driven by economic concerns. That is, employees rationally consider opportunities made available to them and then do whatever is necessary to achieve the greatest personal and financial gain.

## Scientific Management

* Replacing rules of thumb with science \(organized knowledge\).
* Obtaining harmony, rather than discord, in group action.
* Achieving cooperation of human beings, rather than chaotic individualism.
* Working for maximum output, rather than restricted output.
* Developing all workers to the fullest extent possible for their own and their company’s highest prosperity.

## 14 Principles of Henry Fayol

### Division of Labor

Work of all kinds must be divided & subdivided and allotted to various persons according to their expertise in a particular area.

### Authority & Responsibility

* Authority refers to the right of superiors to get exactness from their sub-ordinates.
* A manager may exercise formal authority and also personal power.
* A manager must be prepared to bear responsibility to perform the work in the manner desired.

### Unity of Command

* A sub-ordinate should receive orders and be accountable to one and only one boss at a time
* He should not receive instructions from more than one person

### Unity of Direction 

* People engaged in the same kind of business or same kind of activities must have the same objectives in a single plan.
* Without unity of direction, unity of action cannot be achieved.

### Equity

* Equity means combination of fairness, kindness & justice. 
* The employees should be treated with kindness & equity if devotion is expected of them.

### Order

* This principle is concerned with proper & systematic arrangement of things and people. 
* Arrangement of things is called material order and placement of people is called social order.

### Discipline

* Discipline means sincerity, obedience, respect of authority & observance of rules and regulations of the enterprise.
* Subordinate should respect their superiors and obey their order.

### Initiative

* Initiative means eagerness to initiate actions without being asked to do so.
* Management should provide opportunity to its employees to suggest ideas, experiences & new method of work.

### Remuneration

* Remuneration to be paid to the workers should be fair, reasonable, satisfactory & rewarding of the efforts. 
* It should accord satisfaction to both employer and the employees.

### Stabilityof Tenure

* Employees should not be moved frequently from one job position to another i.e. the period of service in a job should be fixed.

### Scalar Chain

* Scalar chain is the chain of superiors ranging from the ultimate authority to the lowest. 
* Communications should follow this chain. However, if following the chain creates delays, cross-communications can be allowed if agreed by all parties and superiors are kept informed.

### Sub-ordination of Individual Interest to common goal

* An organization is much bigger than the individual it constitutes, therefore interest of the undertaking should prevail in all circumstances. 
* The interests of any one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organization as a whole.

### Espirit De’ Corps

* It refers to team spirit i.e. harmony in the work groups and mutual understanding among the members. 
* Espirit De’ Corps inspires workers to work harder.

### Centralization

* Centralization refers to the degree to which subordinates are involved in decision making. Whether decision making is centralized \(to management\) or decentralized \(to subordinates\) is a question of proper proportion. The task is to find the optimum degree of centralization for each situation.

## Bureaucratic Organizations

Bureaucratic organisation approaches can be described as an organisation striving for maximum efficiency based on the following principles

* A clear division of labour with jobs being well defined and done by people who are \(or can become\) highly skilled at performing the tasks of the particular job.
* A clear hierarchy of authority.
* Formal rules and procedures that are impartially and universally applied to guide staff behaviour and performance.
* Employee selection and promotion based on merit.
